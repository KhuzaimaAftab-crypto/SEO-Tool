# Vercel Deployment Steps

## Prerequisites
1. Your GitHub repository is already connected to Vercel
2. All dependencies are listed in package.json
3. The latest changes have been pushed to GitHub

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your "SEO-Tool" project

### Step 2: Monitor Automatic Deployment
- Vercel should automatically detect your latest push to GitHub
- Look for a deployment in progress with status "Building" or "Deploying"
- The deployment should use these settings:
  - Framework Preset: Next.js
  - Root Directory: `seo-tool`
  - Build Command: `npm run build`
  - Output Directory: `.next`

### Step 3: Manual Deployment (if needed)
If automatic deployment doesn't trigger:
1. In your project view, click the "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Or click "Create Deployment" to start a fresh deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Module Not Found Errors**
   - Fixed: `tailwind-merge` and `clsx` are now properly listed in dependencies

2. **Build Command Issues**
   - Confirmed: Build command is `npm run build` in package.json

3. **Framework Detection**
   - Confirmed: Vercel should detect Next.js automatically

## Environment Variables
Make sure to add your GitHub token in Vercel project settings:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add:
   - Key: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your GitHub personal access token

## After Deployment
1. Once deployment completes, Vercel will provide a live URL
2. Test the URL on both desktop and mobile devices
3. Share the URL with your friends

## Support
If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check deployment logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies in package.json are correct
3. Verify vercel.json configuration
