# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Current Status
Your GitHub repository is already connected to Vercel. The latest changes have been pushed to GitHub, which should trigger an automatic deployment.

## How to Check Deployment Status

1. **Visit Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Sign in to your Vercel account
   - Find your SEO-Tool project in the list

2. **Check Deployment Progress**
   - Click on your project to view details
   - Look at the "Deployments" tab to see the current deployment status
   - The latest deployment should show as "Building" or "Deploying"

## Manual Deployment Options

If the automatic deployment doesn't trigger, you can manually deploy:

### Option 1: Redeploy from Dashboard
1. In your project view, click the "Deployments" tab
2. Find the most recent deployment
3. Click the three dots menu (â‹¯) next to it
4. Select "Redeploy"

### Option 2: Use Vercel CLI
1. Install Vercel CLI globally:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd seo-tool
   ```
3. Deploy to production:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Module Not Found Errors
The "tailwind-merge" module not found error has been fixed by ensuring it's listed in your package.json dependencies:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "tailwind-merge": "^2.5.5",
  "clsx": "^2.1.1"
}
```

### Build Configuration
Your vercel.json is properly configured:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Check your Vercel dashboard for the deployment status
2. Once deployment is complete, your live URL will be available in the Vercel dashboard
3. Share this URL with your friends to showcase your SEO tool
